```
$ go run . < some_text
```

and this will parse the text and print "add to calendar" links for Google Calendar.

This used to be a feature of Google Calendar in the pre-AI era, and then they removed it,
and then somehow they never added it back despite Google being an "AI company" now or
whatever?

(This shells out to https://github.com/evmar/ai, my OpenAI wrapper.)
